 *  @param priority The priority to apply.

The block is part of the task itself and should therefore be lightweight (otherwise use GCD to send time-consuming operations on another thread). Beware that if managed objects are returned, they can only be used from within the block associated thread, not on another thread you would dispatch work onto.
